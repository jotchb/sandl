- Use the ambient noises by pressing play under the ambient noise box and adjusting the volume sliders of each desired noise according to how you want it played.
- Set a timer by entering in the hour and minute amount you want the timer to play out for. A small jingle will play when the timer is up; it can be reset whenever.
- Switch the scenery by clicking the top right button. Then, from the dropdown, select the city you want to see.
- Hide the UI elements by clicking the hide button at the top left. To show the UI elements again, simply click the button again (it is now titled 'show')
